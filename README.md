# Analysis-and-Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  In this course the goal was to write pseudocode for runtime algorithms and then implement that code to process the run-time and memory of various data structures.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
	The data structures are important to understand because they are the basis of how the memory structures process information, so you know what data structure is appropriate for the data you intend to search.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
	This project and class involved a lot of roadblocks.  The instruction was unclear on many of the tasks and the book work didnâ€™t teach you how to code the various data structures or how to implement them correctly.  I had to use a lot of outside resources to even get close to what was asked of me in this assignment.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
	Knowing that data structure will work the quickest with the least amount of memory required will help for designing the most efficient code.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	This project helped to learn how to program in modules to allows for code to be reused on various projects.
